“I have some stuff that I want to do a DH project with. How do I get started?” Answering this question (and getting started doing DH) involves several related questions about data: What data/materials do you work with? What format are your data/materials in? What does the format of your data allow you to do? How can you transform your data to do different things with it? What are the stakes of the choices that you make?  This course guides participants through answering these questions in relation to their own research areas, datasets, and materials. You will start by introducing us and your classmates to your data -- and will proceed to create versions of your data/material designed to help you have conversations about your project goals with librarians, technologists, and/or colleagues.          
<br><br>
This workshop provides an introduction to different types and formats of data (structured, unstructured, etc.), to the work associated with data (building and using vocabularies, working with data models, normalization, cleaning); and best practices for documenting and sharing that work. We will look at a selection of existing projects to see how they use data, and what choices they have made. We will identify potential tools (candidates include AntConc, Omeka, Scalar, Google Fusion Tables, and Tableau) for new scholars to use while developing their projects, and provide them with a rubric for evaluating additional tools. Often people coming into DH believe that they need to learn to code -- but coding is just one of many possible tools. We will guide participants through a structured exploration of how coding might allow them to pursue their research question(s) (or might not!), and help them evaluate what sort of coding skills they might want to learn at some point in the future.  We will also explore ways to integrate thinking in terms of computational methods and techniques, such as approaching research via systemic or algorithmic thinking. Our goal is to provide participants with the basic skills that they need to understand what kind of data they have (or could obtain), what tools are likely to be a good fit for that data, and what skills they might plan to learn in the future.          
<br><br>
Note: We recommend that you bring a sample of your own material/data to work with during this week (i.e., between 10 and 30 objects); though we do have a couple of datasets that you can use if you prefer (more info <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G8bnd_KnSBvNU06mBZgGHWlmm3Neuk__QcSynq7Q1RI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!).  We also welcome pairs/small groups who would like to work on the same dataset during the week.

Intended for university administrators who seek an understanding of the
Digital Humanities that is both broad and deep, this offering establishes
a cohort that [1] meets as a group for three dedicated sessions before the first
day of DHSI (on the Sunday beforehand) and several dedicated session midweek to survey and discuss pragmatic DH basics and chief administrative issues related to supporting DH and those who practice it at their institution, [2] allows those enrolled to audit (as non-participatory observers, able to go from class to class) any and all of the DHSI courses, and [3] individually engages in consultation and targeted discussion with the instructors, who are the first three chairs of the international Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations (ADHO), speakers and consultants contributing to the course, and others in the group outside of course time during the institute.

<br><br>
Priority for involvement in the course will be given to first-time attendees among those actively in academic administrative roles and training toward them.

<br><br>
Please note that this course begins with a meeting on Sunday 3 June 2018, further details TBA.

This course demystifies and offers a survey of the computational tools and techniques being used for literary criticism. Aimed at novice and DH-curious scholars and practitioners, participants gain familiarity with fundamental concepts and methods so that they can better appreciate the potential of computer-assisted critical techniques. Classes are divided between discussions of key theoretical considerations and practical instruction in a selection of tools. Participants are exposed to macro-analytical techniques like most frequent word analysis, collocation, stylometry, topic modelling, and network analysis, gaining experience with instruments like Voyant, R, Python, and Gephi. The course also details best practices relating to the preparation and management of digital corpora. Having completed this course, participants will have a better understanding of how computational methods can be used to produce quantitative data for use in the support of literary criticism. More advanced expertise can subsequently be developed at any one of a number of DHSI offerings dedicated to particular methods.

This class will focus on using digital tools to enhance and deepen traditional ways of reading and analyzing texts. We will explore ways of answering questions about authorship, textual, chronological, and authorial style, genre, and meaning. The first sessions will introduce some freely-available tools and some widely available general software, and will address the issues of planning a project, and finding/creating and preparing the texts for analysis. We will begin with some prepared groups of texts for guided investigation as a group, so that we can concentrate on general problems, issues, and opportunities. Because my own background is in literature, the emphasis will be on literary texts. In later sessions, participants will be able to use these tools (and perhaps others, depending on their interests) to explore texts of their own choosing, or to examine some already-prepared sets of texts in greater detail and depth. The backgrounds and experiences of the participants will undoubtedly differ; therefore, we will aim for an intensely collegial and collaborative atmosphere, so as to capitalize on these differences. <br><br>Most of the tools and methods work across different languages, though there may be some problems with transliterated and accented languages, and there is a good deal of variation in how effective different techniques are for different languages. Most also require a substantial amount of text–either one long text or at least several texts of 1000 words or more. On the other hand, this class will focus on relatively detailed and intensive analysis, and is not appropriate for those who are interested in working with huge data sets or very large numbers of very long texts. For the purposes and methods of this class, a set of 100 novels should be considered a very large amount of data. <br><br>We will be meeting in a computer lab where all the software used will be available. Much of the work will be done in Minitab (a statistical analysis program) and in tools that operate in Microsoft Excel. Minitab for the Mac unfortunately does not yet perform the main functions we will need, so Mac users will need to run Minitab on the lab computers (unless they have a dual-boot system that includes MS Windows). Potential participants whose own computers are Macs and/or who have specific (groups of) texts or kinds of problems in mind that they would like to work on in the class should definitely contact the instructor before enrolling to discuss any potential difficulties or challenges.

You wouldn’t take a cross-country road trip without knowing how to change a tire, why would you run a project in the cloud without knowing how to do a security patch? Learn the basic mechanics of cloud environments in this hands-on course and gain the confidence you need to carry-out today’s digital research projects. Whether you’re running a web site, scraping the web, blogging, or building a portal, being able to look under the hood to make quick assessments and fixes is essential.
<br><br>
This course begins by introducing cloud computing as a concept and the role it can play in your research, whether you need a persistently available computing environment for a web service, or more computing power than your laptop can offer for Big Data problems and anything in between. The first project we will cover is setting up a standard HTML based website in order to introduce all the basics of working in a cloud computing environment. We will then walk through using the command line and how it can be used to configure your cloud computing environment for your specific research projects. Mediawiki, Omeka, Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress are popular content management systems (CMS) that have almost identical deployment methods and so while we will choose one of these to introduce security topics such as data encryption and password management it will be representative of all these deployments.  Finally we will use cloud-based tools to automate the setup of your cloud computing environments allowing it to be duplicated, shared, and scaled up as needed.  With this general background covered you will have all of Thursday to deploy a cloud-based project of your own choosing.
<br><br>
In summary, once this week is over you’ll have experience deploying flexible, customized, web-based computing environments that can power your digital research projects.  It won’t make you a better road-tripper (sorry) but it will make you a better digital humanist.

This course focuses on using sound(s) for Digital Humanities (DH) scholarship and pedagogy. Course topics include sound utilization, forms, and respect for associated intellectual rights. Course emphasis is practice-based research and/or creative expression, learning by making. Participants are encouraged to bring laptops, digital recorders, headphones, and smart phones. GarageBand will be the primary demonstration tool, although Audacity is a good open source alternative. Other sound recording and editing platforms may also be used as desired. No previous experience with sound is required. Participants will learn basic sound recording, editing, and manipulation, and may leverage these and other course resources for ongoing DH sound projects, or experiment freely. A sound artifact (collaborative or solo) demonstrates course outcomes at the end of the week. More information at the course webpage: <a href="http://www.nouspace.net/john/courses/dhsi-sound.html">http://www.nouspace.net/john/courses/dhsi-sound.html</a>.

This is a praxis course for teaching faculty and instructors who come to DHSI with a specific digital humanities course proposal. The emphasis is on workshopping these courses, identifying learning objectives, building assignments, creating rubrics and forms of assessment. As part of this workshopping we will survey existing humanities courses that incorporate a significant digital humanities component in their design, including but not limited to research-based and experiential learning, public digital humanities, cultural/media studies, interdisciplinary and team-taught courses, and the distinctions between introductory, advanced undergraduate and graduate course expectations. Where possible, consulting visits (both in person and virtually) from instructors who have  taught courses such as these will be included. Participants leave DHSI with a fully-formed and teachable syllabus.

This course provides a hands-on introduction to the accumulated wealth of text processing tactics and strategies from the past four decades. We'll use them, and consider them in the context of the cultural histories of computing and publishing technology from which they arise: a blending of  'hack' and 'yack'. Over the week we'll work with a range of tools and toolkits, and explore methods for integrating and making text processes more efficient and more convivial. We'll go from venerable Unix tools (like regular expressions) to XML and markup concepts through to latter-day digital production methodologies -- useful for everything from cleaning up documents and data to preparing things for publication. We'll fold, spindle, and mutilate documents using tools like markdown, git, and regex, in pursuit of grace, elegance, and fine typography. Participants should bring a laptop and an article or other body of text to work with over the week. Some experience with HTML and CSS would be an asset, as would basic familiarity with the Unix command line.

This course has three aims. The first is to introduce participants to the world of 3D modelling.  What methods and software are available to generate 3D content?  What languages are used to support their expression and dissemination over the Internet?  The second purpose is practical:  it will provide an introduction to 3D modelling, and show how such an activity can be integrated into courses devoted to digital history, virtual heritage, architectural history and theatre history, and related disciplines in archaeology and anthropology.  Here participants will be introduced to Sketchup, an 3D modelling software package developed by Google that can be procured for free, or for minimal cost in an education institution.  They will also be introduced to the 3D Virtual Buildings Project 2.0, a free on-line tutorial that will provide instruction in Sketchup, and in the use of historical sources to produce 3D models.  The third aim of the course will be to explore the pedagogical benefit of 3D modelling.  How can such activities support student learning, and in particular the development of their constructive and critical thinking skills?

This course will explore all aspects of conceptualizing, planning for, and creating a digital edition. It provides a basic introduction to the various types of digital editions, the practice of editing in the digital age, and a survey of the many digital tools available to serve project goals. Approaching a digital edition means taking time to think about how end-users will want to work with a particular edition. Beginning with the research and analytical needs of end-users in mind, editors are better able to develop effective editorial strategies that will result in a dynamic, useful, and usable, digital edition. In this course, participants will engage in hands-on learning and group discussions related to project conceptualization, editorial policies and processes, and the selection and use of digital tools that can serve the needs of researchers and other end-users. Participants will bring a few sample materials they are working with.  We will use these in a class project - creating a digital edition over the course of the week using skills learned in each session.  Our goal is for participants to return to their home institutions ready and able to build upon, enhance, and transform these initial ideas into robust digital editions.

Data visualization - the representation of information through images - is a powerful and innovative tool for extending traditional methods of research toward new audiences and ends. In this workshop, we will explore ways to creatively visualize data for research, rendering information more useful, engaging and accessible. From boutique data to big data, we will examine both qualitative and quantitative datasets to create a variety of visualizations, including illustrations, mindmaps, infographics, sparklines, data matrices, and interactive graphic displays. Over the course of the week, participants will work with open source platforms and tools for translating data into visual and interactive forms, while discussing principles of narrative, audience and design 
<br><br>
Working in skills-based teams, participants will then brainstorm and prototype an interactive narrative experience that tells a story with/around/about data, whether a web-based visualization, a physical object or installation, or an interactive documentary experience. This workshop invites participants from diverse fields and backgrounds--including data scientists, writers, teachers, designers, artists, and coders—with a shared interest in creative problem-solving and collaboration. No specialized experience is expected or required. Participants are welcome to bring their own project ideas and datasets to use when developing visualizations during the workshop.

Electronic literature is described as born digital literary work––that is, literature produced with and only experienced on a computing device. Exhibits at the MLA, the Library of Congress, UC Berkeley, and Rutgers-Camden, as well as MOOCs (“Electronic Literature”) that drew thousands of participants and courses (“Digital Humanities Electronic Literature,” Winona State U), and symposia (“Digital Cultures in the Age of Big Data,” Bowling Green State University) show a growing interest by digital humanists in Electronic Literature. This course, led by leading scholars and artists of the Electronic Literature Organization, offers DH scholars a formal, in-depth study that provides a good understanding of electronic literature’s antecedents and traditions, authors and works, theories and methodologies, scholarly approaches, and artistic practices. It combines seminar and workshop methodologies so that participants gain the background needed to critique and interpret and teach electronic literature with knowledge of its production.

Over the past five-years we have seen a proliferation of academic job advertisements, publications, and discussions demonstrating ways in which race and social justice can be engaged in digital humanities scholarship.  Interest by students and local communities in technological advancements through Web 2.0, social media, and mobile phones are permitting new forms of research and practice.  #transformDH, #DHpoco, #femDH, and #BlackLivesMatter have helped to challenge the all-white discourse, often dominated by scholars in the disciplines of English and history, that is too often found in digital humanities.  What happens to students in digital humanities methods classes who bring non-traditional bodies into this world?  There have been discussions how to insure that syllabi and materials for digital humanities classes are inclusive  - specifically, how an introductory DH methods class keeps race, social justice, and inclusivity as cornerstones in their pedagogy.  The traditional divides witnessed in the tech world will only be replicated in the world of both undergraduate and graduate DH courses without attention to race, social justice, etc.  This week-long class will show how, through an interdisciplinary intersectional and CRT framework, both race and social justice can be central to any DH teaching, pedagogy and practice.  The course will pay special attention to queer theory, critical ethnic studies, postcolonial theory, WOC/Black feminism, Indigenous studies, and disability studies as they currently help to reshape digital humanities teaching and methods across our university/college classrooms.

This course is an introduction to the XML ecosystem and its uses in research on literary and historical documents. Participants will begin with the fundamentals of XML. They will be introduced to several of the most important applications of XML and related technologies, including HTML5, KML, SVG, and TEI, and they will explore ways to manipulate XML with xQuery, which can be useful for the presentation of their data. This will be done using XML database and text-editing applications, all of which  are open source.
<br><br>
Intended for researchers in the humanities and humanistic social sciences who are newcomers to DH methods, the course assumes no familiarity with scripting or encoding, though beginners might find the pace to be challenging, given the range of material presented. Students who are already familiar with TEI and website design would still benefit from the units on analytic tools, advanced XML, and xQuery, which are central to the course.

From YouTube, to image repositories, to podcasts, to scraping media from web services likeeBay, Reddit, and 4Chan the wealth of information available to humanities scholars that fallsoutside the realm of “traditional sources” is staggering and will continue to increase for theforeseeable future. Traditional scholarly approaches will still have their place among these newmedia objects but will frequently need to be used in conjunction with methods for handling largevolumes of new media. But what are these methods and when/how are they used? Thiscourse answers these questions by starting from a basic introduction to media types and theirpotential research value and then leading the hands-on process for building a pipeline forprocessing each, from collecting the material through to processing it and finally storing it.Exact sources of the media to be used are still being considered but still images, sound files,and video will all feature prominently. No previous experience working with media files of anytype is required but would certainly be an asset.

Digital games are often studied as texts, as objects of research.   However, given that games can function as simulations, models, arguments and creative collaboratories, game-based inquiry can be used as a potential method of humanities research, communication and pedagogy.  This course will  explore the ways that simple game environments can be used as research, reporting and teaching tools that involve broad communities of players and publics in creative problem solving, open social scholarship, scholarly communication, and engaged and immersive learning. Participants will be introduced to the affordances and constraints of multiple game types, including transmedia gaming, alternate reality games, vast narrative games and serious games.  We will explore existing examples, discuss realistic planning, development and outcome logistics, and critically engage with the theoretical and practical implications of game-based scholarly engagement as participants work towards the development of their own prototypes (which may or may not be exclusively digital).

This course teaches participants how to use ethical visualization principles and practices to visualize treacherous, or culturally problematic, data. Such data includes racist historical documents, ideologically laden materials, culturally controversial texts, politically charged topics, gendered works, etc. Aimed at people who work with culturally sensitive datasets, and those who are interested in critical reflection on visualization practice, the course will combine hands-on activities and discussion. Participants will create data visualizations using R and instructor-provided stock code, and then interrogate their visualizations, identifying the extent and severity of the ethical pitfalls they inevitably contain. By the end of the week, participants will have produced several visualizations and prepared a position statement on ethical visualization appropriate for their own cultural and disciplinary contexts. No previous knowledge in coding, R, or visualizations is required. Participants are welcome to bring their own treacherous data, or they may use sample projects provided by the instructors. If you are unsure as to whether your data will work in this class, please feel welcome to contact the instructors in advance.

This course is for those who are interested in current trends in humanities publishing. It provides an introduction to the various platforms used by digital scholarship groups for innovative multimodal publishing projects. This workshop will specifically focus on publishing project management and workflows with WordPress and Drupal and tools to support those projects. We will also cover critical aspects of digital publishing projects that are often overlooked in project proposals including intellectual property issues, sustainability, and creating funding proposals for nontraditional publishing projects. Participants are encouraged to bring their current projects to the workshop for group breakout sessions on the topics of platform development, intellectual property, funding, and project management. The goal of this workshop is to introduce participants to the elements of digital publishing development and management and provide spaces to explore applications and solutions for potential or current projects.

This course explores how digital humanities projects have traditionally managed data and how opening access to data changes the DH project. We will cover the reasons for publishing open data, how we can create open data, and how we can work with open data. We will see how linked open data allows us to share data and incorporate data from other projects. We will learn about data models, data formats, and software tools for working with linked open data.  Students should be comfortable with the basics of the UNIX command line: running commands, browsing the file system, viewing text files, and editing text files (a good introductory text such as <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Quick_Introduction_to_Unix">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Quick_Introduction_to_Unix</a> should be sufficient).  Students should bring a Mac or Linux (e.g., Ubuntu) laptop. For those unable to do so, we will provide remote access to an Ubuntu server for data processing.

Access to image-based resources is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Digital images are a container for much of the information content in the Web-based delivery of images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials. Yet much of the Internet’s image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications. A growing community of the world’s leading research libraries and image repositories have embarked on an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery. IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) has the following goals: To give scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world, To define a set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories, and To develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, such as image servers and web clients, that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.” (http://iiif.io). This course will introduce students to the basic concepts and technologies that make IIIF possible, allowing for guided, hands-on experience in installing servers and clients that support IIIF, and utilizing the advanced functionality that IIIF provides for interactive image-based research, such as annotation.

Although there is a deep history of feminist engagement with technology, projects like FemTechNet argue that such history is often hidden and feminist thinkers are frequently siloed. In order to address this, the seminar will offer a set of background readings to help make visible the history of feminist engagement with technology, as well as facilitate small-scale exploratory collaboration during the seminar. Our reading selections bring a variety of feminist technology critiques in Media Studies, Human-Computer Interaction, Science and Technology Studies, and related fields into conversation with work in Digital Humanities. Each session is organized by a keyword - a term that is central to feminist theoretical and practical engagements with technology - and will begin with a discussion of that term in light of our readings. The remainder of each session will be spent learning about and tinkering with Processing, a programming tool that will allow participants to engage in their own critical making processes. </p><p>Pushing against instrumentalist assumptions regarding the value and efficacy of certain digital tools, we will be asking participants to think hard about the affordances and constraints of digital technologies. While we will be engaging with a wide range of tools/systems in our readings and discussions, we anticipate that the more hands-on engagement with Processing will help participants think about operations of interface, input, output, and mediation. In addition to the expanded theoretical framework, participants can expect to come away with a new set of pedagogical models using Processing that they can adapt and use for teaching at their own institutions.

This course will introduce students to modern frontend web development technologies, specifically using the programming language JavaScript. As JavaScript becomes increasingly more powerful, a variety of powerful tools—including ES6, React, Redux, Immutable.js, and Webpack—are driving a paradigm shift in web development toward single-page applications. These data-driven websites do most of the work of rendering and serving web pages inside a user’s browser, with a minimal backend. This class assumes students have some experience with a programming language (Python), have used a text editor, and have encountered the command line. In this class, students can expect to learn how to build these kinds of powerful, portable apps for their own datadriven projects. The course will also introduce students to SASS, the powerful, programmable CSS engine that is widely used for cutting edge projects. By the end of the class, students can expect to be familiar with current best-practices for developing cutting-edge JavaScript applications that can be deployed in minimal server environments, such as Heroku, GitHub Pages, and Amazon EC2.

This course is aimed at those— whether or not they have a digital humanities project in mind—who wish to learn more about “book culture” in history and contexts from the medieval through modern periods. Each class session will combine lectures with individual and small group hands-on work with items from UVic Libraries’ Special Collections and Archives to focus on the circumstances of production and reception of textual objects over time. By providing an overview of textual creation, transmission, and preservation, this course will offer digital humanists an introduction to the methodologies and reference tools (historical, codicological, and contemporary) necessary to understand a book in its original contexts and thus to make informed encoding decisions for the digital era. We will explore the technological shifts that made textual culture possible (quill, ink, paper, lithography, TEI, etc.) so that we can locate our current textual moment within a larger technological history. Students will learn about the process of textual creation in both pre-and-post digital eras in order to produce a basic bibliographic description and digital surrogate by week’s end.

This class is designed to serve two purposes. Its main goal is to introduce participants who would "like to do something digital" but do not know how to get started to the process of designing a digital project. Students will be taken through the project development process, including ideation, data collection, tool selection, data analysis, and distribution. Through group and class discussions and activities, participants will gain experience using APIs (like DPLA) to collect data, learn the basics of structuring humanities data for analysis, and discover both the affordances and limitations of digital tools.  In order to not limit the class to theoretical discussions and ensure students get hands on experience with these concepts and skills, they will be asked to create a small digital project using Omeka (or Omeka S, if in a stable beta state), the popular, open-source digital exhibits platform. Students will learn how to add collected data to Omeka, as well as gain exposure to structuring humanities data for analysis through the use of plugins for creating relational data, collections, maps, timelines, and annotation tools. Finally, the students will be introduced to the modularity of digital projects by using the Omeka API, to get their data back out of Omeka. In addition, students will be asked to write several short blog entries describing their original project idea and how that idea was shaped through working with a digital tool.

<br><br>
<em>
Since the focus of the class is on the project development process and less on the actual tools (in this case Omeka/Omeka S), the class may be a good precursor to more technically-oriented classes, such as "Digitization Fundamentals and their Application," "3D Modelling for the Digital Humanities and Social Sciences," or "Geographical Information Systems in the Digital Humanities." While students will be using a pre-setup server version of Omeka for their course project, instructions and assistance will be provided for installing Omeka and other software used in this course on their computers.

This course will explore models for doing DH at four year institutions.  Over the past half-decade liberal arts colleges and four-year institutions have begun to engage in the development of robust programs in the digital humanities.  With a focus on teaching, these institutions have also developed frameworks in which we can incorporate students into our research agendas in meaningful and productive ways.  Within a collaborative, interdisciplinary lens we will address approaches to teaching and research, developing models for sustainable infrastructure, student integration, project and resource management.  Discussion will include administrative issues related to the recognition of collaborative efforts in DH.  Participation is encouraged from across all areas of the institution including library and IT professionals, administrators, and faculty.  Individuals who are interested in growing digital humanities and digital scholarship in their unique institutional settings should attend.  Guest lectures will be included as part of the course structure.

This course is intended for humanities-based researchers with no programming background whatsoever who would like to understand how programs work behind the scenes by writing some simple but useful programs of their own. Over the week the emphasis will be on understanding how computer programmers think so that participants will be able to at least participate in high-level conceptual discussions in the future with more confidence. These general concepts will be reinforced and illustrated with hands-on development of simple programs that can be used to help with text-based research and analysis right away. The language used for most of the course will be Python because of its gentle syntax and powerful extensions. Using the command-line interface and regular expressions will also be emphasized. We will also spend some time taking glimpses at what is happening in the other DHSI courses to understand how reading and writing programming code goes well beyond what we touch on in this class.

This is an intermediate-to-advanced course in stylometry: the analysis of countable linguistic features of (literary) texts. While stylometry has been usually associated with authorship attribution, recent research shows that the same methods can be used in a much broader context of literary study. The statistics of such text features as word, word n-gram or letter n-gram frequencies, apart from being a highly precise tool for identifying authorship, can in fact present patterns of similarity and difference between various works by the same author; between works by different authors, between authors differing in terms of chronology or gender or genre or narrative styles; between translations of the same author or group of authors; between dialogic voices in novels. This in turn provides a new opening in literary studies; and the results of stylometry can be compared and confronted with the findings of traditional stylistics and interpretation. The participants will be able to learn some of the more useful stylometric tools and methods, from simple wordlist-making to multivariate analyses of word and phrase frequencies to complex graphs and networks. 
<br><br>
The instructors will present their own suite of packages written for the R statistical programming environment, which has proven itself to be a very efficient tool; the packages are a way to avoid R’s usually steep learning curve, so no expert knowledge is required. The texts used for the workshops can be provided by the instructors; if necessary, the participants’ individual corpora will be expanded as needed and as available (online or elsewhere). The texts will be literary, multilingual, and include both originals and translations.

Digital storytelling might be defined as the combination/collision/collusion of storytelling techniques and features and affordances of digital media. This course focuses on literacy with approaches to digital storytelling, fluency with resources, and making individual or collaborative digital stories. Course topics include storytelling as a fundamental human activity, combining storytelling techniques and computational technologies, organizing and managing digital storytelling projects, and using digital storytelling for Digital Humanities (DH) scholarship and pedagogy. Course emphasis is practice-based research and/or creative expression, learning by making. A range of approaches to digital storytelling will be considered—audio, oral/aural history, linking multiple lexia (hypertext), multimedia, and transmedia—each with an eye toward providing compelling narrative experiences. No previous experience with digital storytelling or associated platforms is necessary. Examples and resources are provided. Participants will learn basic approaches and tool utilization, and may leverage these and other course resources for ongoing DH projects, or experiment freely. A storytelling artifact (collaborative or solo) demonstrates course outcomes at the end of the week.

Modelling the Textual Universe Through Mapping: This course will question one of the most important practices in Digital Humanities, namely, digital mapping of texts. The students will go though an extensive model building experiment using the map exhibition tool Neatline. They will also create reports in the form of textual blogs and compare what can be expressed in each of the two media. By comparing the different student projects in discussion sessions we will look into what kind of maps can be made based on different types of texts, and the degree to which mapping is meaningful for different texts.
<br><br>

Through the course the students will understand better where the information we put on maps come from. How much is read from the text and how much is added from other sources, including the reader’s previous knowledge? To what degree is the information silently adjusted to fit the map medium? How much of what we express in text and as maps are steered by the medium? Through this course the students will not only learn how to make map exhibitions based on texts but will also explore how modelling in the form of media transformation can be used as a text analysis tool.

The course will be relevant to all humanities researchers who are interested in the geographies that their sources may hold, or whose research questions are geographical in nature. The course offers an introduction to the theory and practice of using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in the digital humanities. It will cover: converting humanities sources into GIS, georeferencing maps, querying and manipulating data within a GIS, producing high-quality cartographic output, and disseminating GIS material using virtual globes. It will be primarily based on using the ArcGIS software package although we will also introduce other software such as Quantum GIS (QGIS). The use of Google Earth to disseminate the outputs from GIS projects will also be included. The types of sources that we will cover include maps, texts and tabular data. The potential for using images and multimedia material will also be discussed.
<br><br>We do not assume any familiarity with GIS although a good level of general competence with computers is helpful. Some advance reading may help. Additionally, if you have your own data that you would like to use in GIS and use then please bring it along as the final sessions of the course will allow you to work with you own data if you so wish.<br><br>

This course will survey pertinent research in Open Access (OA) methods, theory, and implementation, and it will look forward to open social scholarship. Overall, we will consider the role of OA knowledge dissemination in academia and at large. We’ll focus on the history, evolution, forms, and impact of OA within the domain of scholarly communication. Specific topics of discussion include advocacy, infrastructure, intellectual property rights, research evaluation metrics, online journals, databases, and peer review methods and limitations in this context. Using OA as a foundation, we will discuss the rising trend and potential impact of open social scholarship, which involves the creation and dissemination of research and technologies to a broad, interdisciplinary audience of specialists and non-specialists. This course will be geared toward students, librarians, scholars, publishers, government representatives, and others who are invested in the open development and sharing of research output.

This course takes an introductory approach to machine learning in digital humanities topics. Participants will learn essential concepts in machine learning and use machine learning tools (including Mallet and Weka) to collect and analyze literary, historical, and social media data sets using a number of machine learning approaches. The course will include an optional introduction to the R programming language; knowledge of this language will provide students with an opportunity to develop their own machine learning algorithms. In addition to the technical dimension of machine learning, we will also discuss the hermeneutic challenges posed by machine learning to the digital humanities, particularly as technical decisions enable specific ways of engaging in humanities scholarship: In what ways do DH scholars need to be cautious about the 'results' offered by machine learning algorithms, and what is the relationship between those results and humanities forms of knowledge?  
<br><br>
Neither programming expertise nor a computer science background are required. Students are encouraged to bring their own projects to the course in place of the provided data sets.

While DH and queer/LGBT+ studies (which includes queer inflected perspectives from other disciplines) arguably share a common ethos, there has not yet been much explicit consideration of queerness in relation to DH. The course will offer a forum for such a consideration. Questions to be considered include: 
<br> 
<br>-What is the value of bringing together DH and queer studies?
<br>-What does DH bring to queer studies? What does queer studies bring to DH?\
<br>-To what extent should we differentiate between DH work that engages with queerness as its content vs. as its methodology?
<br>-What might it mean to queer DH itself? How can we understand DH as already queer?
<br>-What are the opportunities and obstacles for a queer DH within larger structures of academia and funding?
<br>-Is there a tension between the push toward skill-building and the mastery of technical tools within DH and the social critique that a queer DH engenders?
<br>-In terms of intersectionality, what are the limitations of thinking about DH from the perspective of queerness? What other relevant perspectives exist?
<br>-How do these issues speak differently to different stakeholders in DH, such as researchers, librarians, educators, etc.?
<br><br>
 
These questions can be grouped under two larger areas of inquiry. The first asks us to consider the ontology of DH definitions, concepts, terms, tools, and methodologies. The second centers on the lines between the work that we do and also how we do it, both queering DH tools and methods and working with queer folks, identities, and communities. These two areas of inquiry will structure the course, providing participants with opportunities to discuss and debate readings and ideas, as well as engage in hands-on explorations of digital tools, programming, classification systems, protocols and best practices in working with queer communities and artifacts.

In this workshop we work with data from thematic research collections to extract, visualize, analyze, and interpret implied cultural networks. A cultural network is a graph (or network) of people, places, events, symbols, or other entities represented by texts, images, and other communicative artifacts (media). The main learning goal is to follow the process of discovering and interpreting cultural networks from so-called raw data to analysis and visualization to interpretation. Using the R language and RStudio, we will acquire and prepare cultural data, and then generate and visualize graphs using a variety of methods, such as networks and heat maps. We will also provide theoretical context for this work by reading essays on the interpretation of cultural data. Students who have taken DHSI starter courses in programming, databases, visualization, or some form of quantitative analysis will find this workshop a useful opportunity to apply these skills. The course is meant to integrate the DH skills and concepts in the context of a rich example.

Fedora Commons is a mature open source data repository platform. Under the hood, it is a cluster of tools for managing the life cycle of digital resources and their metadata: ingestion, presentation, preservation, search, export. Islandora is a widely used front end to Fedora Commons. In this class, we will explore the conceptual and technical details of the architecture of Fedora Commons, specifically with the goal of exposing the choices that need to be made about component options (authentication/authorization, indexing, search, storage, schema, etc.) that depend on the specific goals of the target implementation (variety, scale, duration, exposure). We will also look at the technical issues that will arise as an implementation grows beyond its original vision. Students will build an instance of Fedora Commons/Islandora while addressing their design goals in the context of learned best practices, long term management strategies, and practical policies and procedures. No prior experience is expected, but exposure to the Linux command line, web services, metadata schema, etc., would be an asset.

Games are a popular and quickly growing area of study in humanist disciplines. This course combines treatments of game criticism, game theory and game development toward understanding how to approach this medium as an object of research. We discuss games broadly, which includes table top games, board games, video games, card games, etc. Part of the course will provide instruction about creating a playable prototype game as part of game-first research -- ultimately combining theoretical aspects of game studies with the practical application of game building for both newcomers and experienced game scholars. Our focus in the course is to learn how games are structured and how they function, so prototypes are built with scissors, paper, and ideas to keep the focus on playtesting and iterative design.

Learn XPath intensively and gain superpowers with XML processing! Whether you’ve recently learned XML and want to build something with it, or whether you’ve worked with XPath before but are rusty, new and experienced coders will benefit alike from our course. XPath is usually not the center of a DHSI class, and people often gain hasty "ad hoc" experience with it when learning it only along the way to doing something else. Concentrating intensively for a week on XPath will "power up" what you can do with XML, and will help you refine the way you code your documents. Our course will assist XML coders (whether beginners or experienced) with complex processing of information from markup and from plain text. Our goals are 1) to share strategies for systematically building archives and databases, and 2) to increase participants’ confidence and fluency in extracting information coded in XML in those archives and databases.

Because we can “dig” latent information out of the document “strata” of texts, we think of working with XPath as something like planning an archaeology project, turning an XML project into a carefully managed digital dig site for cultural data! In our course you’ll gain experience with writing precise and powerful XPath to illuminate information that isn’t obvious on a human reading. We'll apply XPath to check for accuracy of text encoding--to write schema rules to manage your coding (or your project team's coding). You'll learn how XPath can help you to build exciting visualizations from XML code (such as to make a chart like a timeline or a network graph). We'll write XPath to calculate how frequently you’ve marked a certain phenomenon, or locate which names of people are mentioned together in the same chapter, paragraph, sentence, stanza, footnote, or other structural unit.
<br><br>
XPath is the center of the course, but we will show you how it applies in multiple XML processing contexts so that you learn how these work similarly and how these are used, respectively, to validate documents and to transform them for publication and other reuse. Thus, we devote serious, sustained attention to writing and applying XPath by surveying how it is expressed in a variety of frameworks (including XSLT, XQuery, and Schematron), with a variety of materials (including XML and plain-text documents), and involving a variety of task types (such as “date arithmetic” to calculate how much time elapsed between dates and “string surgery” to look for and manipulate patterns inside your coded elements). You'll gain fluency with XPath expressions and patterns, including sequence expressions, type expressions, regular expressions, predicates, operators, functions (from the core library and user-defined), and other features, and we'll practice these in different XML-related contexts (including XSLT, XQuery, and Schematron). Whether you are an XML beginner or a more experienced coder, you’ll find that strengthened skills in XPath will help you with systematic encoding, document processing, and project management.

Archives reveal the context in which authors and artists create works of literature and art.  From drafts of manuscripts, diaries, photoalbums, scrapbooks, financial and legal records, and correspondence researchers can explore the creative process, biography, literary circles and intellectual spheres.  For this reason archives are rich resources on which to build digital humanities projects with impressive examples including The Shelley-Godwin Archive (http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/) and Photogrammar (http://photogrammar.yale.edu/).  There is extensive writing within the scholarly community considering archives, ranging from Michel Foucault’s The Archaeology of Knowledge and Jacques Derrida’s Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression to contemporary memoirs, such as Arlette Farge’s The Allure of the Archives.  Yet what are archives really?  This workshop is designed to provide digital humanists with a foundational understanding of archives, including the theories and practices which underpin how such material has been historically collected, arranged, described, and accessed.  Hands-on work with archives, and a deeper understanding of archival theory, will provide humanities scholars with a richer intellectual framework within which to interpret, analyze, and explore the meanings and potentials embedded in the archival endeavour.

This course provides a foundation for scholars interested in learning more about the uses, ethics, and implications of surveillance. We will discuss current trends in surveillance—airport security, traffic cameras, phone applications, wearable technology, and self-surveillance—as well as build our own surveillance devices. In doing so, we will be able to examine the types of data both intentionally and unintentionally collected and discuss the ways in which this information is collected, stored, and processed. By the end of the course, participants will be knowledgeable about current surveillance methods and scholarship, their own participation in surveillance culture, and growing trends in surveillance technology.

This course will introduce you to many techniques available to process, analyze, and visualize textual data with Python. You will be introduced to the theory and method of a discipline within computer science called Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will discover why Python is an excellent language for text analysis and why Python 3 has some advantages over its predecessor, Python 2.7, for these tasks. We will use many of Python's built in functions for handling text, but we will spend the majority of our time working with the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK). The NLTK is a large library of tools and resources that will allow us to conduct part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and text classification. Experience with Python is not strictly required for participation in the class, but a general understanding of programming methods and terms will be an asset. Generally speaking, this class will help you think about humanities problems through computation. More specifically, you will understand the kinds of questions we can answer with NLP techniques and methods.

The purpose of this course is to improve our digital security, and our understanding of the digital security challenges in our lives as researchers. We’ll begin by exploring common security problems through an examination of some particular case studies of catastrophic breaches and failures. Then, we’ll talk about how to avoid them in our own lives and work. This means ensuring best practices for our information security. This involves keeping our software up-to-date, using encryption to secure our machines and their communications (including, but not limited to, SSH, mail, messaging (e.g., Signal, OTR), DNS, and web browsing), using good credential management (password managers, two-factor auth), properly deploying a firewall, and verifying the integrity of software packages by checking hashes. We’ll also discuss ways to control and define our online presence.
<br><br>
Related to this is a matter of increasing importance in our current political and social climate: future-proofing your research data. We’ll start with the basics: mitigating malware threats, avoiding catastrophic data loss, and creating verifiable, multi-sited archives of our work. This will start with leveraging tools like Git or BitTorrent Sync (and hopefully ipfs) to mitigate the risks of simple deletion, and move to a discussion of encrypted backups. Building on this, we’ll look at ways to ensure our data’s survival in the event that a funding agency/academic institution/government attempts to seize, permanently delete, or censor it. Part of this discussion will focus on deploying infrastructure alternatives to institutional IT systems, using resources like the Internet Archive to capture our sites and data, and choosing a hosting provider that will defend your data and privacy.
<br><br>
Ultimately, by the end of the course, you should have a much stronger sense of the things you can do in your day to day lives to ensure that your data is secure and long-lived.

Background: Big Data is the current Big Thing but this does not mean that it is generally well understood orstraightforward. Looking around the web will reveal that Big Data must have anywhere fromthree to nine properties (all of which must start with the letter ‘V’) and that it fluctuatesbetween being an actual thing that could be handled and acquired by anyone to a generalconcept for approaching highly specialized datasets that few people will ever have access to.This general state of affairs generally leaves researchers with at least three questions: Wherecan they get Big Data? How should they process Big Data? Where can Big Data processingbe done? A course that addressed these questions while giving participants hands onexperience with actual datasets that have volume, variety, veracity, velocity, etc., and that aredrawn directly from Humanities repositories or from Humanities based interests would go along way to empowering researchers.<Br><br>
This course is intended for researchers who are looking to handle datasets that they can nolonger comfortably process on a desktop computer, typically because the data no longerworks well with standard tools or data storage formats. To get the most out of this courseparticipants should have a general familiarity with unix stylecommand line interfaces andhave a project or two either in mind or at hand that they suspect could benefit from what thiscourse provides. Emphasis is split between identifying tools and methods to handle suchdata (based on the properties of that data as well as the skills of the research team and thesystems available to handle it) and hands onwork that will generate understanding andimpart relevant skills. Participants will be exposed to the creation of big data sets throughweb scraping and data aggregation, data formats for handling these results, processingtechniques such as parallel processing, Hadoop, H Base, and Spark that can be run onCompute Canada systems, and attention to output formats for visualization.

It might sound obvious to say that not everyone accesses information in the same
 way, but in practice, we often assume otherwise. People with disabilities of many different kinds--sensory, physical, and cognitive--represent a significant percentage of users for many digital projects. Digital humanists can ensure that they are designing
 for a wide range of users by taking accessibility into account from the beginning of a project, and existing projects can be adjusted and modified to improve their accessibility.
<br><br>
This course will take a two-fold approach to
 issues of accessibility and the digital humanities: students will read and discuss key works from disability studies in order to consider various applications for DH; these readings will form a critical framework for students’ hands-on work with tools that
 enable them to evaluate and create accessible digital resources. Students are encouraged but not required to bring their own projects or project ideas in order to evaluate them for accessibility and to make (or anticipate) changes as appropriate. Knowledge
 of and experience with web design is not required, but curiosity and a willingness to learn are a necessity.

This course will focus on building community in collaborative digital learning environments and will interrogate notions of outcomes, best practices, and instructional design. Our work together will be productive, grounded in praxis, and driven by learner experiences.
<br><br>
Digital Humanities, with its deep reliance on technological tools, is replete with courses about those tools. This course offers an alternative: It is an exploration of pedagogy, challenging teachers to re-think how they approach their classes and interact with their students. We will discuss critical pedagogy and the importance of letting students define, control, and take responsibility for, their learning environment. This course will also serve as a playground, letting participants experiment with critical digital pedagogy in a class-created open-access online course that we co-design, build, deploy, promote, and assess, all within the one-week seminar. Participants will leave with a better understanding of their approaches to teaching and how critical digital pedagogy applies to DH courses.

The open source content management system Drupal
 allows users to build complex and highly customized websites and web-based applications without having to write any custom code. Drupal powers a wide range of digital humanities sites, including professional organizations, journals, databases, and individual
 scholarly projects. This course is intended for anyone who wants to play a hands-on role in developing digital humanities websites, or web interfaces for digital humanities data. The course will cover Drupal installation and configuration, developing and implementing
 a data model for your content, using Drupal's UI to query your data and develop search and browsing interfaces, importing and exporting data, and how to maintain a Drupal site. Advanced topics will be addressed as needed by individual projects. Class sessions
 will include time for participants to work on their own project(s) with guidance and feedback from the instructor, or experiment with the example sites provided.
<br><br>
No programming experience is necessary, but previous
 use of other content management systems (such as WordPress or Omeka) is recommended. Participants are asked to bring their own computers, and a project idea, along with a few pieces of content (texts, images, etc.) to use when developing the site. Contact
 us in advance if you're having trouble thinking of a project idea</a>.

Preserving and studying artifacts from earlier computing eras presents interesting challenges as technologies obsolesce. These challenges are not uniform but instead vary depending on the nature of the technological environments from which the artifacts emerged. Drawing from materials in the University of Victoria collections and further afield, this workshop will provide an introduction to strategies for working with digital artifacts created with 1980s technology. Topics to be covered include recovering content from obsolete media, working with emulated computing environments, and the challenges (and rewards) of hardware preservation. Attendees will have an opportunity to work hands-on with floppy disks, install and configure emulators, and  try out a selection of period computing equipment.

They are often used to extract postal codes, phone numbers, and emails from large sets of documents and when combined with a little bit of scripting they can turn tedious and error prone work done “by hand” into fast, effective, and automatic searching.  In this workshop you will learn the basic syntax for regular expressions and deploy them to  extract useful information in cases where doing it “by hand” would be tedious.

3D visualization has been used in traditional scientific computing domains for the past several decades to visualize the results of multidimensional numerical simulations. In humanities 3D visualizations have been mostly restricted to specialized areas such as game engines, architectural renderings, virtual environments, photogrammetric processing, and visualization of point cloud data. In this course we will approach 3D visualization from a more traditional perspective: visualizing multidimensional data as an extension of interactive 2D plotting into the third dimension. Students will get hands-on with several simple problems using one of the modern open-source tools for interactive 3D data analysis. No prior visualization experience is needed.

Fieldwork
 has been central to pedagogy in many scholarly disciplines. Archaeological digs, geographical surveys, and ethnographic interviews readily come to mind, but the proliferation of international general education and study abroad programs has also introduced
 new opportunities for humanities-based fieldwork. As a pedagogical practice, fieldwork involve learning by doing through an immersive encounter with research in action. It might encompass learning by travelling and dwelling in a spatially-demarcated field,
 or bringing cultural artifacts here through digitization. We think that digital culture, and the new methods and tools it is introducing, are transforming the practice of fieldwork, for scholars and students alike. This workshop will introduce participants
 to digital methods in humanities fieldwork, drawing on case studies and focusing on Omeka and WordPress content management systems. Participants will leave with an introduction to digital fieldwork methods, inspiration for implementing them in research and
 teaching, and critical insights about fieldwork as a practice in digital environments.

It is imperative that digital humanists address the colonial legacies and problematicdiscursive practices plaguing the contemporary technoscape. Progressive scholarship musttake on the arduous task of dismantling the inherent colonization of the digital domain andinfrastructure. This workshop aspires to: (1) examine the ways in which colonialideologies and extractive research methods are naturalized within hegemonic DH principles andpractices (2) introduce De-/Anti-/Post-colonial DH pedagogies and insurgent research practicesthat workshop attendees can incorporate into their DH tradecraft. We will destabilize dominantunderstandings of the digital by discussing wampum as hypertext, and will consider thecomplexities of terms such as “postcolonial,” “decolonial,” “anti-colonial,” and “decolonizing” asthey relate to Digital Humanities.
<br><br>The workshop sutures theoretical perspectives from black, Indigenous, and postcolonialdiscursive practices, along with insurgent research methods and critical digital pedagogicalpraxis. We privilege the voices of black, Indigenous, and queer people of colour, and celebratethe provenance of grassroots community movements and teachings. The skills trainingcomponent acquaints workshop participants with alternative learning management systemsthat respect Indigenous cultural knowledges, such as http://mukurtu.org , and decolonial digitalprojects such as The People and the Text.

</p><p>


The workshop is an introduction to the Graph Poem Project (#GraphPoem, http://bit.ly/2nTvStN) involving tools for poetry computational processing and graph theory applications in poetry and poetic corpus analysis. The machine learning classifiers developed by our team at uOttawa provide automated analyses of features such as poetic topic, meter, sonic techniques, diction, and figures and speech, and then quantify commonalities between poems and cross corpora based on the analysis output. Those commonalities are translated into the edges uniting the poem-vertices within a corpus or a number of corpora. The graph theory applications then automatically analyze the resulting graphs for network-specific features, based on which they provide relevant data analysis on and critical insight into the poetic corpora under scrutiny. Refined text analysis tools converge therefore with data-intensive-driven corpus analysis providing tools and algorithms useful in literary criticism, digital literary studies, computational linguistics, creative writing, and computational poetry generation.

Indigenous writers, artists, and programmers have made fundamental contributions to cyberspace from its inception, both in its development as a literary trope and as a medium to create and share stories and information. As a notional environment, however, cyberspace is still largely considered a space without place, which, for many, calls into question its applicability in Indigenous worldviews. Given the centrality of land in Indigenous epistemologies and the ongoing threats to traditional territory by colonial governments, precisely what a “landless territory” might mean within the context of Indigenous studies is an evocative and pressing issue, particularly as more and more Indigenous people take to the Internet to create and share stories and data.
<br><br>
Featuring a workshop from Indigitization, a B.C. based collaborative initiative between Indigenous communities and organizations and a keynote presentation from award Nisga'a poet and scholar Jordan Able (2017 recipient of the Griffin Poetry Prize), this symposium offers a critical, yet affirming theorization of Indigenous cyberspace that emphasizes the work created by Indigenous authors, scholars, programmers, activists, and information scientists. It argues for a more complex, nuanced understanding of Indigenous cyberspace and illustrates the ecologies through which Indigenous and allied communities are connected in landless territories. Participants will engage with key readings and projects in the field of Indigenous New Media and learn from Indigenous and allied scholars working with digital tools across a variety of platforms and fields.

Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a technique whereby representations of individual autonomousbeings are generated and programmed to behave in a specific way in order to observe theresult of these individual agents interacting on the system as a whole. It is a technique that isnot generally used in humanities or social sciences scholarship but which is becomingincreasingly accessible due to advances in tools and available computing power. In this fullyhands-on workshop you will learn to generate ABMs using a tool/programming language calledNetLogo. With this package participants will quickly find themselves producing sophisticatedvisualizations of two-dimensional worlds with accompanying charts that are updated in real-timeto track important system variables. Whether you are considering ABMs as a method ofhumanistic inquiry or you’d just like to play god over worlds of artificial beings this workshop isdesigned to put you on the path to success.

The history of technology is intertwined with that of textiles, and the roots of many modern applied sciences and technologies lie in the ever-evolving fabrication – of fabrics. Even though this connection is still highly viable (e.g. 3-D printing, medical implants) the critical nature of raw materials and textile production is now mainly obscured behind practices of industrial manufacture. Thus, we most often think of fabric as for clothing and simply in terms of fashion – forgetting that the materials are resources (natural and otherwise) which bear significant social consequences (factory workshops, global merchandising, bottom-line economics).
<br><br>
The concept for this workshop is to spend some time in hands-on experience with a wide variety of fibres, metals and fabrics, developing further understanding of the potentials and costs in pursuing, or ignoring, their special characteristics.  Samples of materials for specific consideration will be provided.   Register early for this workshop and receive by post a skein of woolen yarn for making your own project to bring and show!
<br><br>
This workshop should be of further interest to those who also consider: Wearable Technology, The Pre-Digital Book, Desktop Fabrication, social justice issues - and anyone who wears clothing.

This workshop is intended for anyone interested in learning more about dynamic ontologies and their applications for humanities scholarship. No prior knowledge about ontologies or Protégé is required, and participants are welcome whether or not they have an ontology project in mind. Ontology development is an emerging method in the humanities for representing knowledge in a given field so that it is machine readable. Ontologies allow for new scholarly insight by structuring knowledge according to classes, properties, and logical axioms and allowing machine reasoning to infer relationships that can lead us toward new research questions. Participants will learn what an ontology is, how Protégé can be used to build an ontology, and how to evaluate existing Web Vocabularies and apply them to their own research.
